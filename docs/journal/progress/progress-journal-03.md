# Progress Journal - Entry 03

## Date: 2025-04-12

## Branch: tasks/project-structure-setup

### Completed Tasks

1. **pnpm Integration**
   - Added pnpm workspace configuration with pnpm-workspace.yaml
   - Updated package.json with pnpm-specific settings
   - Created .npmrc file for pnpm configuration
   - Generated pnpm-lock.yaml file

2. **Turborepo Configuration Update**
   - Updated turbo.json to use the new "tasks" field instead of "pipeline"
   - Fixed TypeScript configuration for project references

3. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Added "composite" setting to core package for proper project references
   - Fixed type errors in the codebase

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Build Setup**
   - Ensure all packages build successfully
   - Fix any remaining TypeScript errors

2. **Local Development Environment**
   - Set up Docker Compose for local development
   - Configure AWS SAM for local Lambda testing

3. **Testing Setup**
   - Implement unit tests for Lambda functions
   - Set up integration tests with LocalStack

### Notes

- pnpm provides better performance and more strict dependency management than npm
- The combination of pnpm and Turborepo works well for monorepo management
- TypeScript project references require the "composite" setting for proper build dependencies
