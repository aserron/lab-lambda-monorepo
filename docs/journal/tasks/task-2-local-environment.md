# Task 2: Local Development Environment Setup

## Overview

This task involved setting up a comprehensive local development environment for AWS Lambda functions using TypeScript. The environment uses Docker Compose with LocalStack to emulate AWS services locally, allowing for faster development and testing without deploying to the cloud.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Node.js and pnpm installed
- Git for version control
- AWS CLI installed
- AWS SAM CLI installed

## Subtasks

### Subtask 2.1: Configure Docker Compose with LocalStack

- Created `docker-compose.yml` with LocalStack and supporting services
- Added health checks for services to ensure proper startup
- Created environment variables file for Docker Compose
- Updated documentation for the local development environment
- Handled Docker image availability issues by focusing on essential services

#### Issues and Solutions

**Issue 2.1.1: Docker Image Availability**
- **Problem**: Some Docker images specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file were not available or required authentication.
- **Root Cause**: The images either didn't exist in Docker Hub or were private repositories.
- **Solution**: Modified the Docker Compose file to focus on essential services (LocalStack) and commented out problematic services.
- **Prevention**: Research image availability before including in Docker Compose files and consider using more widely available alternatives.

### Subtask 2.2: Create Local Development Scripts

- Updated existing scripts for starting and stopping the local environment
- Created new script for hot-reloading during development
- Added script for deploying Lambda functions to LocalStack
- Implemented Lambda function testing script
- Updated documentation for the development scripts

#### Issues and Solutions

**Issue 2.2.1: Script Execution Permissions**
- **Problem**: Scripts were not executable by default.
- **Root Cause**: Git doesn't preserve execution permissions across platforms.
- **Solution**: Added explicit `chmod +x` commands to make scripts executable.
- **Prevention**: Include instructions in the README to make scripts executable after checkout.

### Subtask 2.3: Configure AWS SAM for Local Testing

- Created SAM configuration file (samconfig.toml)
- Added scripts for running AWS SAM locally
- Created example event files for testing Lambda functions
- Updated package.json with new scripts for AWS SAM

### Subtask 2.4: AWS CLI Configuration

- Configured AWS CLI to work with LocalStack
- Created helper script (`aws-local.sh`) for AWS CLI commands
- Updated all scripts to use the helper script
- Set up AWS credentials for local development

#### Issues and Solutions

**Issue 2.4.1: AWS CLI Configuration**
- **Problem**: AWS CLI commands were failing when trying to interact with LocalStack.
- **Root Cause**: AWS CLI was not configured to use the LocalStack endpoint.
- **Solution**: Created a helper script (`aws-local.sh`) to set the correct endpoint and credentials.
- **Prevention**: Document the AWS CLI configuration requirements and provide helper scripts.

### Subtask 2.5: Verification and Documentation

- Created verification script for the local environment
- Documented LocalStack and AWS CLI configuration
- Created comprehensive verification guide
- Added troubleshooting information

## Learnings

1. **LocalStack Configuration**
   - LocalStack provides a powerful way to emulate AWS services locally
   - Proper configuration of environment variables is crucial for LocalStack to work correctly
   - Health checks are important to ensure services are ready before use

2. **AWS CLI Integration**
   - AWS CLI can be configured to work with LocalStack using the `--endpoint-url` parameter
   - Creating a helper script simplifies the use of AWS CLI with LocalStack
   - AWS credentials for LocalStack can be dummy values (test/test)

3. **Docker Compose Setup**
   - Not all Docker images are publicly available or maintained
   - It's important to check image availability and consider alternatives
   - Health checks and dependencies between services ensure proper startup order

4. **Verification Importance**
   - Verification steps are crucial for each component of the local environment
   - Automated verification scripts save time and ensure consistency
   - Comprehensive documentation of verification steps helps troubleshoot issues

## Verification

The local development environment can be verified using the following steps:

1. **Start the Local Environment**
   ```bash
   pnpm run start:local
   ```

2. **Check LocalStack Health**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:4566/_localstack/health
   ```

3. **Verify AWS Resources**
   ```bash
   pnpm run aws:local dynamodb list-tables
   pnpm run aws:local s3 ls
   pnpm run aws:local sqs list-queues
   ```

4. **Test Lambda Functions**
   ```bash
   pnpm run test:lambda hello-function events/hello.json
   ```

5. **Run the Verification Script**
   ```bash
   pnpm run verify:local
   ```

## Documentation Created

1. **LocalStack and AWS CLI Guide**
   - Comprehensive guide for setting up and using LocalStack with AWS CLI
   - Configuration instructions and examples
   - Troubleshooting information

2. **Verification Guide**
   - Detailed guide for verifying the local environment
   - Test scripts and expected results
   - Troubleshooting common issues

3. **Documentation Rules**
   - Established rules for creating documentation optimized for both humans and LLMs
   - Structured templates for different types of documentation
   - Guidelines for maintaining documentation
