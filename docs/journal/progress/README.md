# Progress Reports

This directory contains progress reports documenting the development progress over time. Each report captures what was accomplished during a specific period, what challenges were encountered, and what's planned next.

## Purpose

Progress reports serve several purposes:

1. **Progress Tracking**: Document what was accomplished during specific periods
2. **Challenge Documentation**: Record challenges encountered and how they were addressed
3. **Planning**: Document what's planned for the next period
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Share progress and learnings with the team
5. **Historical Record**: Maintain a historical record of the project's development
