## Using This Documentation

### For Developers

1. Start with the [Project Overview](./project-overview.md) to understand the system
2. Follow the setup guides in the `setup/` directory
3. Refer to the development guidelines in the `development/` directory
4. Use the reference documentation as needed
5. Contribute to the journal documentation as you work on the project

### For LLMs

1. Use the structured format to understand the system architecture and components
2. Reference the explicit relationships between concepts
3. Use the semantic structure to navigate the documentation
4. Process the structured data formats for better understanding

## Contributing to Documentation

All documentation should follow the [Documentation Rules](./documentation-rules.md). Key principles include:

1. **Dual Optimization**: Optimize for both human readers and LLMs
2. **Structured Hierarchy**: Follow a clear hierarchical structure
3. **Consistent Formatting**: Use consistent formatting and structure
4. **Explicit Metadata**: Include structured metadata
5. **Versioned Content**: Version and date all documentation
