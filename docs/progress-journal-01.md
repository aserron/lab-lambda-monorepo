## Branch: tasks/project-structure-setup

### Completed Tasks

1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Created a monorepo structure using Turborepo
   - Set up the basic directory structure:
     - `packages/core`: Shared utilities and types
     - `packages/lambdas/http-api`: REST API Lambda functions
     - `packages/lambdas/websocket`: WebSocket Lambda functions
     - `packages/lambdas/events`: Event-driven Lambda functions
     - `packages/infrastructure`: For IaC (to be implemented)
     - `packages/frontend`: For optional frontend (to be implemented)
     - `docker`: For Docker configurations (to be implemented)
     - `scripts`: For development scripts (to be implemented)
     - `docs`: For project documentation

2. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Created root `tsconfig.json` with base configuration
   - Set up package-specific TypeScript configurations
   - Configured path aliases for easier imports

3. **Core Package Implementation**
   - Created shared types and utilities
   - Implemented common API response helpers
   - Set up error handling utilities

4. **Lambda Function Templates**
   - Created HTTP API Lambda handler template with AWS Lambda Powertools
   - Implemented WebSocket Lambda handlers for connect, disconnect, and message events
   - Set up S3 event processor Lambda template

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Event-Driven Lambda Implementation**
   - Implement SQS consumer Lambda function

2. **Infrastructure as Code Setup**
   - Set up AWS CDK for infrastructure deployment

3. **Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Create Docker Compose setup for local development

4. **Local Development Environment**
   - Configure AWS SAM for local Lambda testing
   - Set up hot-reloading for TypeScript development

### Notes

- The project is following a modular structure that promotes code reuse
- AWS Lambda Powertools is being used for logging, tracing, and metrics
- TypeScript path aliases are configured for easier imports between packages
